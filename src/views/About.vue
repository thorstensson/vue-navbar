        <h1>About Ernest Shackleton</h1>
        <p>Born in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland, Shackleton and his Anglo-Irish family[1] moved to Sydenham in
            suburban south London when he was ten. Shackleton's first experience of the polar regions was as third
            officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery Expedition of 1901–1904, from which he was sent home
            early on health grounds, after he and his companions Scott and Edward Adrian Wilson set a new southern
            record by marching to latitude 82°S. During the Nimrod Expedition of 1907–1909, he and three companions
            established a new record Farthest South latitude of 88°23′ S, only 97 geographical miles (112 statute miles
            or 180 kilometres) from the South Pole, the largest advance to the pole in exploration history. Also,
            members of his team climbed Mount Erebus, the most active Antarctic volcano. On returning home, Shackleton
            was knighted for his achievements by King Edward VII.</p>

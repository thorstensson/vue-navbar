# NavBar - Vue - JS - BEM

A simple and responsive navigation bar with full modal on smaller devices. Hides on scroll down. Needed to code this up to refresh my mind on how to, instead of using a component library. And I love doing UI stuff. BEM makes it easier; still a semantic fan.

## Demo

## Roadmap

- [X] Tidy up overwritten (S)CSS.

- [X] Add hide animation on scroll down.

- [X] Changed fonts to my pet fonts for 2025, or two of them, for consistency across repos.

- [X] Revamped colors to follow primary, secondary and accent, following my Colorpace theme which will reoccur
across most repos.
## Contributing

Fork and improve, I write too much CSS!
